# Word Counter, 11_16_18

#### This website is an application that will count iterations of words in a sentence.

#### By Cristian Lucero

## Description
This is a program that will gather an initial word from the user, and a sentence to follow along. The sentence must contain the inital word more than once. The program will then count how many times that word appears in the sentence in full words only. (Ex. If "cat" is entered and the sentence entered is, "There has been a catastrophe." the first letters of catastrophe will not be counted.) 

## Specs
#### Behavior: The program will ask the user to enter an initial word.
* Example Input: "Dog"
* Example Output: "Your first word is "dog"."
#### Behavior: The program then asks the user for a sentence that contains the initial word more than once.
* Example Input: "Sometimes my dog will play with my friend's dog."

#### Behavior: The program will tell user the cost of their pizza
* Example Input: "Enter"
